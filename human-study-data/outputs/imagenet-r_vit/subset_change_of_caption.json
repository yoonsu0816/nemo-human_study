        "explanation": "The model may have been misled by the intricate folding of the dollar bill in this image, which could have resembled the detailed craftsmanship of a guitar's body. The lack of recognizable guitar features like strings and frets might have contributed to the misclassification.",

        "explanation": "The model might have been misled by the similarity in the background elements such as the palm trees and the sunset, which are common features in images of toucan and shield. The model may have focused on these elements instead of recognizing the distinct shape and features of the toucan.",

        "explanation": "The model might have been misled by the close-up view of the lava in this image, which could have resembled a cauldron due to its swirling and bubbling appearance. The model's failure to recognize the broader context of the volcanic landscape in the image of cauldron contributed to the misclassification.",

The model may not have sufficiently considered the specific breed characteristics that distinguish a Border Collie from other collies.",
